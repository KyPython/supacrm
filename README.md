### **üõ°Ô∏è Security & Data Integrity**

The security model is a core highlight of this project. Supabase's **Row-Level Security (RLS)** is leveraged to provide a secure and scalable foundation. Each user's data access is strictly limited based on their role and ID, making it a powerful demonstration of database-level access control.
